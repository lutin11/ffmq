### FFMQ ChangeLog

## 4.0.11

- **[Fix]** storage: fix bug when new message requires more than one auto-extend (thanks jowerner)

## 4.0.10

- **[Fix]** Notify exception listener on auto-acknowledge failure

## 4.0.9

- **[Feature]** Add support for 'transport.tcp.ssl.trustManager' in client-side properties to specify a custom SSL Trustmanager implementation.

## 4.0.8

- **[Fix]** Pre-fetching could stop randomly on consumers listening to multiple destinations (thanks to mmlab.de engineers)

## 4.0.7

- **[Fix]** When a message listener is set after the connection is started and messages are already available, the listener should not be called using the same thread to avoid deadlock/stale situations

## 4.0.6

- **[Feature]** Upgrade to jms-api-1.1-rev-1

## 4.0.5

- **[Fix]** Discard message on non-transacted put exception (would cause messages to pile up unexpectedly on store full exception)

## 4.0.4

- **[Fix]** Topic properties were not properly persisted in destination descriptor (subscriberFailurePolicy/subscriberOverflowPolicy)
- **[Feature]** Allow to specify message headers on which to index topic subscribers that use a message selector. This can improve performance when using a partitioned topic pattern with a large number of subscribers (reducing dispatch complexity from O(n) to O(1)).
  _Typical use-case_ : if most topic subscribers have a message selector like :
  > (Consumer1) someHeader='key1'
  > (Consumer2) someHeader='key2'
  > ...

  Indexing the subscribers on 'someHeader' will improve dispatch performance 

## 4.0.3

- **[Feature]** Improve lock contention on subscribers list for topics

## 4.0.2

- **[Fix]** Default client properties file was not properly named and was not used

## 4.0.1

- **[Feature]** Allow to start a JMX agent without the RMI layer that may only be accessed locally

## 4.0.0

- **[Feature]** Upgrade project descriptors to Maven 3
- **[Feature]** Upgraded source/binary level to java 7
- **[Feature]** Use JDK concurrent structures instead of custom ones 
- **[Feature]** Use JDK JMX support and removed mx4j lib usage
- **[Fix]** Activity watchdog was not removing its entries properly
- **[Fix]** Ping packets were not being sent on TCP connections during long transactions, causing premature timeouts
- **[Fix]** Make sure ExceptionListeners are not called by mission-critical threads that cannot afford to wait
- **[Feature]** Add more consistency checks during templates and destinations definitions load
- **[Fix]** LocalQueueMBean getPersistentStoreUsage() should use absolute storage usage instead of current store usage if queue can auto-extend

  _Typical use-case_ : most topic subscribers have a message selector like :
  > (Consumer1) someHeader='key1'

- **[Fix]** Fixed a race condition in the session updated queues list that would cause some messages not to be properly committed in some situations.
- **[Fix]** Fixed some cases where an exception could abort an object close() too early
- **[Fix]** In-memory datastore had a different behavior from the persistent one when full.

## 1.2.2

- **[Feature]** Added support for FFMQ_HOME and FFMQ_BASE system properties to spawn multiple server instances using the same installation
- **[Feature]** Added support for system property replacement in settings and descriptor files

## 1.2.1

- **[Fix]** (JMX) Enforce use of 'management.jmx.agent.rmi.listenAddr' for exported MBean servers too (was only used for the RMI registry)
- **[Fix]** (JMX) Added a workaround to close the MBeans RMI sockets when shutting down the JMX agent
- **[Fix]** Do not synchronize on client-provided message listeners to avoid possible deadlocks with external code.

## 1.2.0

- **[Feature]** Support for asynchronous delivery of notifications to MessageListeners using a thread pool. Slow message listeners no longer hang the whole server.
- **[Fix]** Detect unsupported delivery mode earlier when sending on a topic.
- **[Fix]** Destroying a temporary queue did not clear the associated pending changes in the current transaction, thus causing store exceptions on the next commit/rollback operation.
- **[Fix]** Temporary queues cleanup failed if lock files were present. Lock files are also deleted now.
- **[Fix]** Catch exceptions produced by invalid topic subscribers so they do not break the put operation.
- **[Fix]** JMS expiration was not taken into account. Expired messages are now lazily removed when reading or browsing a queue.
- **[Fix]** Redelivered flag is now correctly set on rollbacked messages. (It still does not survive a server shutdown, though)

## 1.1.0

- **[Feature]** Destinations can now be looked up in JNDI under the names : "queue/&lt;queueName&gt;" for queues and "topic/&lt;topicName&gt;" for topics.
- **[Feature]** Queue browsers are now implemented.
- **[Feature]** A new class allows for an easy integration in the spring framework : net.timewalker.ffmq.spring.FFMQServerBean
- **[Fix]** Pending get operations were incorrectly associated to their consumers instead of the parent session : closing a consumer would then rollback all pending get operations for that consumer. The consumer can now be closed independently of the session lifecycle.
- **[Fix]** Closing a remote consumer/producer would not close the associated objects on the server-side, causing a temporary leak until the session was finally closed.


## 1.0.0

- First release
